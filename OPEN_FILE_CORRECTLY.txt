HOW TO OPEN FILE IN METAEDITOR (CORRECT WAY)
========================================

PROBLEM:
Double-clicking SMC_Session_EA.mq4 opens input dialog, not the code editor.

SOLUTION - Use one of these methods:

METHOD 1: Right-Click Menu (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------
1. In MetaEditor Navigator (left panel)
2. Find: SMC_Session_EA.mq4
3. RIGHT-CLICK on the file
4. Select: "Open" or "Edit" from menu
5. File opens in editor (not input dialog)

METHOD 2: File Menu
--------------------
1. In MetaEditor, click: File → Open
2. Navigate to: MQL4 → Experts
3. Select: SMC_Session_EA.mq4
4. Click: Open
5. File opens in editor

METHOD 3: Drag and Drop
------------------------
1. Open Windows File Explorer
2. Navigate to: 
   C:\Users\test\OneDrive\Desktop\Trading\all bots\SMC_Sessions_EA
3. Drag SMC_Session_EA.mq4 into MetaEditor window
4. File opens in editor

METHOD 4: Double-Click Tab (If Already Open)
----------------------------------------------
1. If file is already open (as a tab)
2. Double-click the TAB at top
3. This maximizes/minimizes the editor

========================================
VERIFY FILE IS OPEN CORRECTLY:
========================================

You should see:
- Code editor with MQL4 syntax highlighting
- Line numbers on the left
- Code visible (not a settings dialog)
- Can scroll through the code

You should NOT see:
- Input parameters dialog
- Settings window
- Property window

========================================
THEN PROCEED WITH:
========================================

1. Press Ctrl+S to save
2. Press F7 to compile
3. Check for "0 error(s), 0 warning(s)"
4. Close MetaEditor
5. Restart EA in MT4
