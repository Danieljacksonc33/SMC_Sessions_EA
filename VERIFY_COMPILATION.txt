TROUBLESHOOTING: TIME MESSAGES NOT APPEARING
========================================

The code is in place, but you're not seeing the messages.
Let's verify step by step:

STEP 1: Verify Code is Saved
-----------------------------
1. Open MetaEditor (F4)
2. Right-click SMC_Session_EA.mq4 → Open
3. Press Ctrl+F (Find)
4. Search for: "TIME CHECK START"
5. You should find it around line 380
6. If NOT found → File not saved properly

STEP 2: Check for Compilation Errors
-------------------------------------
1. In MetaEditor, press F7
2. Look at BOTTOM panel (not just "0 errors")
3. Check for ANY warnings or messages
4. If you see errors about FormatTime12Hour or GetCSTTime:
   → The functions aren't accessible
   → Need to check include order

STEP 3: Verify Functions Exist
-------------------------------
1. In MetaEditor, press Ctrl+F
2. Search for: "FormatTime12Hour"
3. Should find it in dashboard_export.mqh
4. If NOT found → Function missing

STEP 4: Check EA is Actually Running
--------------------------------------
1. In MT4 Experts tab, look for:
   - "initialized" message
   - "News Filter: Disabled" message
2. If you see these → EA is running
3. If you DON'T see "=== TIME CHECK START ===" → Code not executing

STEP 5: Check Line Numbers
---------------------------
The time check code should be at line 378-386.
If it's NOT there, the file wasn't saved.

STEP 6: Force Recompile
-----------------------
1. Close MT4 completely
2. Delete .ex4 file (I already did this)
3. Open MetaEditor
4. Open SMC_Session_EA.mq4
5. Press Ctrl+S (save)
6. Press F7 (compile)
7. Check bottom: "0 error(s), 0 warning(s)"
8. Close MetaEditor
9. Restart MT4
10. Attach EA

========================================
WHAT TO CHECK IN LOG:
========================================

Look for these EXACT messages:
- "=== TIME CHECK START ==="
- "TEST: Code is executing at line 380"
- "Current Broker Time: XX:XX AM/PM"
- "Current CST Time: XX:XX AM/PM"
- "=== TIME CHECK END ==="

If you see "TEST: Code is executing" but NOT the times:
→ Functions have an issue

If you DON'T see "=== TIME CHECK START ===":
→ Code not executing (EA failing before that point)

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: Check Compilation Log
========================================

1. In MetaEditor, after pressing F7
2. Look at the compilation log
3. Copy any errors/warnings
4. Share them with me
